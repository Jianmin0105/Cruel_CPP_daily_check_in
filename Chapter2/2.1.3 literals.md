    * (a) 'a', L'a', "a", L"a"
    * (b) 10 (10 in default, signed int), 10u (10 in unsigned), 10L (10 in long), 10uL （10 in unsigned long）, 012（八进制）, 0xC (十六进制)
    * (c) 3.14, 3.14f, 3.14L （3.14）
    * (d) 10, 10u, 10. （10）, 10e-2 （0.1）
  * Exercise 2.6: What, if any, are the differences between the following definitions:
    * int month = 9, day = 7; int month = 09 (excpetion, 八进制), day = 07;
  * Exercise 2.7: What values do these literals represent? What type does each have?
    * (a) "Who goes with F\145rgus?\012" （string）(b) 3.14e1L （31.4）
    * (c) 1024f
