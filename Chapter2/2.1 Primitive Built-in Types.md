 * `char`: 8 bits
 *  `int`: 16 bits
 *  `long`: 32bits
 *  `long long`: 64 bits
 *  Signed and Unsigned Types
    * the integral types may be `signed or unsigned`
    * A signed type represents negative or positive numbers (including zero); an unsigned type represents only values greater than or equal to zero.
    * The types int, short, long, and long long are all signed. We obtain the corresponding unsigned type by adding unsigned to the type, such as unsigned long.
    * In an unsigned type, all the bits represent the value. For example, an 8-bit unsigned char can hold the values from 0 through 255 inclusive.
    * Use double for floating-point computations; float usually does not have enough precision
* Exercises Section 2.1.1
  * Exercise 2.1: What are the differences between int, long, long long, and short? Between an unsigned and a signed type? Between a float and a double?
    * int: 16 bits; long: 32 bits, long long: 64 bits, short: 16 bits, signed
    * unsigned: all bits represents value, signed: msb is sign
    * double: double precision; float: extended precision
  * Exercise 2.2: To calculate a mortgage payment, what types would you use for the rate, principal, and payment? Explain why you selected each type.
    * double, requires a higher precision.
