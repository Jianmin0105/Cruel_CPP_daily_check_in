**1.1. Writing a Simple C++ Program**
* `function`: return type, function name, parameter list, function body.

* Exercise Section 1.1.1
  * Exercise 1.1
    > .cpp
  * Exercise 1.2

**1.2. A First Look at Input/Output**
* header: `#include`
* `endl`: Flushing the buffer ensures that all the output the program has generated so far is actually written to the output stream, rather than sitting in memory waiting to be written.
* `namespace`: The prefix std:: indicates that the names cout and endl are defined inside the namespace named std.
